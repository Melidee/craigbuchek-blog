<description><![CDATA[Well said, Craig. Your blog brought a tear to my eye. I hadn&#039;t heard about &#039;the new guy&#039;. He seems to be the right person at the right time to do the right thing. May he continue to lead from the front, leading with compassion and honesty and an open heart and mind. Thanks for your inspiring and informative words.
