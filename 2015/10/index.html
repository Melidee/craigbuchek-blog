			<p>The past <a href="http://blog.boochtek.com/2014/01/04/open-source-resolutions">couple</a> <a href="http://blog.boochtek.com/2015/02/02/resolutions">years</a>, I&#8217;ve made New Years resolutions related to advancing my career. I&#8217;ve already started thinking about plans for next year. These goals have helped me focus on making some serious improvements. While I haven&#8217;t met every goal, they&#8217;ve been very effective in upping my game.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m pretty happy with where my career is going, there are other parts of my life that could also stand some improvement. I&#8217;ve recently been focusing on my weight. I&#8217;m down 16 pounds, with another 9 to go; and I&#8217;ll probably see if I can extend the weight loss by another 10 or 20 pounds.</p>
<p>My relationship with my wife has suffered a little over the past few years. She&#8217;d been busy with school the past 4 years. Earlier this year, I had spread myself too thin with my involvement in local user groups, volunteering, and conference presentations. I realize that we have to work on our relationship in order for it to stay strong and healthy. I&#8217;m not really good at knowing how to do that. But I&#8217;m going to try setting some goals that will have a positive effect on my relationship.</p>
<h2>Finishing Things</h2>
<p>I always have a lot of things going on at once. I seem to thrive on multi-tasking. But one down-side is that I leave a lot of things hanging. This happens with many of my side projects, as well as chores around the house. One example is when I do laundry. It often takes me days to fold the laundry, and then sometimes a couple more days to put the laundry away.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to start making an effort to be better at finishing things. I&#8217;ll put the clothes away as soon as I fold them. I&#8217;ll put my dirty dishes in the dishwasher when I&#8217;m done eating.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1.28571rem; line-height: 1.6;">Putting Things In Their Place</span></h2>
<p>This is related to the previous item. It drives my wife crazy when I leave the door to the new pantry open. And it drives her crazy when I leave shoes and clothes (and lots of other things) around the house. While I think she goes overboard in her need for order, I know that it helps her focus on other things when she doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the house being cluttered.</p>
<p>It should only take a little bit of effort to meet her half way. I&#8217;ll focus on keeping the house less cluttered — or at least confined to my own spaces. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll have a positive impact on me as well.</p>
<h2>Being More Conscious of My Time</h2>
<p>When I over-extended myself earlier this year, I had more extracurricular activities than I had time for. I didn&#8217;t do a very good job of planning my activities around each other. I had to give up one of my major activities (being involved with the UNIX and GNU/Linux user groups). Even with that, time for my relationship suffered.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll need to plan my time better, so that I&#8217;m not stressing out with all the things that I need and want to do. I also need to procrastinate less. Being mindful that it&#8217;s affecting my relationship will hopefully help a little.</p>
<h2>Family Retrospectives</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve had this idea for a little while. I&#8217;d like to do a family retrospective. I&#8217;m a little less sure about this one. I&#8217;m not sure I could do a good job of running a family retrospective myself. But I occasionally go to the therapist with my wife. I&#8217;d like to do that more, so we can focus on our relationship in that setting. But I&#8217;d also like to do some of the things that teams do in Agile retrospectives. Like check in on how we&#8217;re progressing on our goals. And brainstorming ideas on things to try to improve things. Perhaps this list will give us a starting point of things we can talk about.</p>
<h2>Focus on the Relationship</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest thing I need to do is to set aside time just to spend with my wife. Quality time. Date night. Spending time with my wife always makes us both feel better.</p>
<h2>Using a Shared Calendar</h2>
<p>As a practical matter, we really need to start using a shared calendar. Well, actually, we already do. But it&#8217;s a paper calendar on the wall at home. That makes it hard to use when we&#8217;re not at home. Finding an electronic calendar that we can both see would be helpful in planning my time and planning date nights.</p>
<p>As my wife always tells me: happy wife, happy life.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve lost 15 pounds over the past several months. I&#8217;m hoping to lose at least another 10 pounds over the next few months; hopefully more like 20 or 30. This is only the 3rd time in my life that I&#8217;ve lost weight. The first was when my mouth was wired shut due to jaw surgery. The 2nd was when a doctor told me to lose 12 pounds to get back to 200. This time was also instigated by a doctor, telling me to lose 25 pounds to get back to 200.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m going to tell you how <strong>you</strong> can lose weight. But you&#8217;re not going to like the answers.</p>
<h2>Stop Drinking Alcohol</h2>
<p>The first time a doctor told me to lose weight, I did it without even trying. I had also stopped drinking for a few months. I hadn&#8217;t connected those 2 things, until I mentioned them both to my aunt.</p>
<p>I only drink maybe 2 drinks a week. That isn&#8217;t really enough calories to make that much of an impact. The only thing I can figure is that alcohol has a big impact on my metabolism.</p>
<p>So when the doctor told me to lose 25 pounds, giving up alcohol was an obvious first step. I knew it would have an impact.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Go on a Diet</h2>
<p>Going &#8220;on a diet&#8221; is a terrible idea. After you&#8217;re done dieting, you&#8217;ll go back to the same old habits as before. You&#8217;ll go back to eating the same things, consuming the same number of calories. If you consume the same number of calories as before, you&#8217;ll end up reaching an equilibrium at the same weight you were at before.</p>
<p>Instead, you need to change your diet — for the long term. Create new habits. You can&#8217;t think &#8220;I only have to do this for a few months&#8221;. Instead you have to find changes you can make permanently.</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll work a little harder until you reach your ideal weight, then let off the gas a bit. But you really have to go in with the mentality that you&#8217;re making permanent changes. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll end up gaining back the weight.</p>
<h2>Learn to be Hungry</h2>
<p>As an American in the 21st century, I have easy access to an abundance of food. Much of it is empty calories — sugar, fat, grease, carbs — junk food.</p>
<p>So when I get a little hungry, I find something to eat. I&#8217;m a terrible snacker. I love donuts and cookies and cakes and pastries. One thing I had to learn is to not just go and get some food at the first sign of hunger. Or just because I&#8217;m bored.</p>
<p>And when I do eat when I&#8217;m hungry, I need to choose better options. Low-fat food doesn&#8217;t work; it&#8217;s got added sugar. Low-sugar food doesn&#8217;t work; it&#8217;s got added fat.</p>
<p>The doctor recommended high-protein shakes. They&#8217;re low in calories, relatively filling, and usually have sucralose or stevia instead of sugar. I&#8217;ve used the shakes to varying degrees. They do help lower the calories I consume in a day, while quenching my hunger pretty well.</p>
<h2>Get Really Sick</h2>
<p>My weight loss started to slow down after a couple months. I went a few weeks without making any progress. Then I got a really bad flu. It only lasted a day, but I couldn&#8217;t keep anything down. My entire gastro-intestinal system was completely emptied out. I lost 7 pounds in a day or 2.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I was able to keep 5 of those pounds off permanently. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d recommend this, but it definitely kick-started another round of weight loss for me.</p>
<h2>Stop Drinking Soda</h2>
<p>This was the hardest thing for me to change in my diet. When the doctor told me some things to do to lose weight, I told him that giving up soda wasn&#8217;t likely to happen easily. It was several months in before I made a significant dent in my soda consumption.</p>
<p>My a-ha moment came during lunch at Panda Express. I ordered a Pepsi like usual, along with my orange chicken and SweetFire chicken. My co-worker had a water. Then it occurred to me, why did I need a sweet drink to go with this sweet food? Since then, I&#8217;ve been more judicious at deciding when to have a soda, and when to have water instead. If you need to, try some zero-calorie water flavorings, like Mio.</p>
<p>A 12-ounce can of soda is about 150 calories. I typically drank about 2 cans a day, perhaps a bit more. Now I&#8217;m drinking probably about 1 can per day.</p>
<p>If you take the standard advice that 3500 calories will lead you to lose 1 pound, and you drink 3 sodas a day, that&#8217;s 1 pound per week. Things aren&#8217;t really that simple in real life, of course. But cutting back on soda can make a significant dent in your caloric intake.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen some reports that say that Americans&#8217; increase in soda consumption is responsible for almost all of the weight gain in American society over the past 40 years.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>This is the one area I need to improve on most. I haven&#8217;t made much of a change to my exercise level yet.</p>
<p>Losing weight really is about inputs versus outputs. Just sitting on the couch, someone my size burns about 2000 calories a day. If I eat 3000 calories (which isn&#8217;t really that difficult), then I have to burn an extra 1000 calories. To burn 1000 calories, I&#8217;d have to do about 90 minutes of strenuous activity, or walk 10 miles.</p>
<p>I just have a hard time finding the time to exercise. I do enjoy doing some yard work, but that&#8217;s only a couple hours a week, and not year-round. I&#8217;ve tried reading while walking on the treadmill, but that makes me a bit dizzy.</p>
<p>Some sort of fitness tracker is helpful. I&#8217;ve got a FitBit. It does help me walk a bit more. I try to walk to lunch most days. But that&#8217;s only a couple thousand steps.</p>
<p>I need to find a way to add more exercise to my life, both to help maintain a better weight, and to improve my health in general.</p>
<h2>Commitment</h2>
<p>I think the real key is making a commitment to make changes in your life. I&#8217;d like to not have a beer belly. I&#8217;d like to be healthier. But the real impetus to change came from my doctor. He asked me to make a commitment to lose the weight. That commitment made a big difference.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve been able to do it. But everyone&#8217;s different. Maybe some of those things won&#8217;t work for <strong>you</strong>. Maybe you&#8217;re not able to make some of those changes. You have to find what works for you. But if it&#8217;s something you need to do or want to do, make a commitment to change your life long-term.</p>
